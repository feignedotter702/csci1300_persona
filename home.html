      <h1>P1. Preparation</h1>

        <p>I choose the kiosk at MacDonald as the accessible interface for this project. MacDonald is somewhere people go to for a quick meal or when they want something late in the night. I observed and interviewed people using the kiosk to order food and check out. After interviewed three people, I come out with the persona and the storyboard.</p>

        <h3>In general, there are these two interactive components on the kiosk:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>The main order screen</li>
            <ol>
              <li>The costumer uses this screen to pull over the menu and select the food they want to order</li>
              <li>After selection they can proceed to check out</li>
            </ol>
            <li>The Payment tab</li>
            <ol>
              <li>insert card or tab the phone on top of the screen to pay</li>
              <li>tape in passcode on the keyboard under the screen</li>
            </ol>

    <h1>P2. Recording Observations</h1>
      <h2>Key observations:</h2>
      <p><b>1. Write a few sentences or bullets describing the key observations you gained from observing your users.</b></p>
      <p>Users go to the kiosk and start ordering the food without much difficulty. They all start with the start order option on the main screen to let the system begin a new order, and in the drop down menu they guided to the wanted place without much hesitation. They all know what they want and use the system with proficiency. After hover on the menu for a few minutes the costumer begin to check out. Two made the payment by using credit card and user used apply pay. Both payment method are aceepted by the kiosk.</p>
        
      <p><b>2. Interview Summary in 5 Bullet Points</b></p>
      <p>Scanned the extracare card, then scanned the purchased items. After that clicked the “finish and pay”, then scanned the paper coupons , then clicked “continue”, then clicked "finish and pay", then the system prompted if the user wanted to use the “extrabucks rewards”. Keep clicking “yes” until there is no more available, then then clicked “continue”, then clicked “No” for the round-up option, and chose “credit” for payment. Inserted credit card as prompted in the pinpad, then clicked “No receipt”.</p>
        <ul>
            <p><b>Do you think it’s more efficient to order on the kiosk than go to the front desk ordering with a waiter?</b></p>
            &nbsp;
                &nbsp;
                <p> - Most users said they use kiosk most of the time and do not go to the front desk that much. Using a kiosk is very time saving and easy to costumize the food right the way they want.
                </p>
            <p><b>Can you find what you want conveniently? Do you think the automated card reader is easy to use?</b></p>
            &nbsp;
                &nbsp;
                <p> - The kiosk is easy to use, and the interface provides the food information without much confusion. You can find the food you want under the right category and the picture annotation is clear. The card reader is also pretty straight forward to use. It's very intuitive to insert the card when you see the card slot.
                </p>
            <p><b>Is there any confusing prompt from kiosk that makes it hard to get right what you want?</b></p>
            &nbsp;
                &nbsp;
                <p> - Most users are very fimiliar with McDonald's food so there are not really any misleading prompt on the menu. However some user says too much option under one category or too much custmize option makes him spend more time deciding.
